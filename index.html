<p>Ciao, my name is Niccolo', and I'm learning the German language. I come from Italy, e la mia lingua madre e' l'italiano, but here I'll write in
    English.</p>

<p>I decided to create this site as a list of interesting things that I learned while studying German, and it's meant to be useful both for me, as
    a record of my progresses, and for every interested reader who is thinking to learn this language from scratch as I am.</p>

<p>I'm learning German because I love the culture and everything that relates with it, <i>in primis</i> the language. Also I'm planning to move to
    Germany in a few years from now.</p>

<p>I'll keep this site updated whenever I find things that I deem important enough to be recorded. If anyone has suggestions, questions or critical
    judgments, you can enter issues or pull requests in the same repository in which this site is hosted.</p>

<p><b>P.S.</b> In case you are wondering, yes, this site is in plain HTML 'cause I'm a backend developer and I don't give a s**t about website
    graphics and nice pictures of dogs or other fluffy animals. Fight me.</p>

<h3>Initial situation</h3>

<p>I knew nothing about German language before starting to study it, except for a few common words as <i>Hallo</i>, <i>Bier</i>,
    <i>auf wiedersehen</i>, <i>kaputt</i> and a few others.</p>

<h3>Learning tools</h3>

<p>To learn German I'm using the following tools:
    <ul>
        <li><i>Grammar books</i>: to get a grip on language grammar and common sentences;</li>
        <li><i>Apps</i>: like Duolingo or HelloTalk;</li>
        <li><i>Books</i>: to see how German is actually used by those who speak it;</li>
        <li><i>Spotify</i>: starting to listen to a lot of songs in German;</li>
        <li><i>Youtube</i>: watching videos in German, using subtitles to grasp the words;</li>
        <li><i>Other</i>: like changing my phone and PC language settings to German, or forcing myself to "think" in German.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>I plan to write in depth commentaries for each of these tools, based on my personal experience and my thoughts on the matter.</p>

<p>Das ist alles f√ºr heute,
    <br>Niccolo'</p>
